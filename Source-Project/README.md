# SourceProject
The Source Project is a web service that provides curated answers to statistical questions. The purpose of the project is to automate the searching process through sources, and prevent the bias that comes from simply using the first number you see. The Source algorithm takes into account the reputability of the source in question and the number of sources that cite a similar answer. It will then return a fairly reliable answer to the query. Example queries are as follows:
"How many soldiers died in the Civil War?"
"How many births were there in the U.S. in 2017?"
